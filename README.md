# Movie-Ratings-Analysis

This project is a data analysis of movie ratings from different genres, users, and years.
The project uses Python and Colab Notebook to perform data manipulation, visualization, and exploration.
The project is based on three data files: u.data, u.item, and u.user. These files contain information about the ratings, movies, and users, respectively. The project aims to answer the following questions:

What are the distribution and statistics of the ratings?
What are the top 25 movies by average rating, considering only the movies that received at least 100 ratings?
How do the ratings vary by genre, year, gender, and occupation?
What are the trends and patterns of the ratings over time?, etc.

The project demonstrates the use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries for data analysis and visualization. The project also shows how to use groupby, join, and aggregation functions to manipulate and summarize the data.
